# Book Management System
Welcome to the Book Management System! This project allows users to browse through a collection of books organized by genre, mark their favorite books, and for administrators, manage the collection by adding or deleting books. This is part of the final project for the PHP course from Business College Helsinki.

# Features
## Visitor Side
Genre Pages: Visitors can browse books organized by genre. Each genre page displays books of the corresponding genre.
Favorite Books: Visitors can mark books as favorites by clicking on the star symbol next to each book. The favorite list is saved on the visitor's device as a cookie.
Dynamic Symbol Display: The system reads the visitor's favorite list from the cookie and displays the correct symbol for each book accordingly.

# Admin Side (Optional)
Authentication: Administrators can log in using a username and password combination.
Add Book: Administrators can add new books to the collection.
Delete Book: Administrators can delete existing books from the collection.
Session Management: Access to admin features is protected using sessions for enhanced security.

# Disclaimer
This project is for educational and practice purposes only.
Do not use it in a production environment without thorough testing and security enhancements.
